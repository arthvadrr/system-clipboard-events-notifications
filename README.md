# system-clipboard-events-notifications
Sends notifications to the os for clipboard events. Meant to provide a visual confirmation of clipboard keyboard shortcuts.

## Requirements
1. possibly osascript. The notifier declares this as a dependency, however the notification is working on my machine without it, so this needs further testing.

## Installation

### MacOS

## Settings (settings.json)
### "sound"
